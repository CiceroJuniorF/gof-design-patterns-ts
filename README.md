# IMPLEMENTATIONS
## 1 - Creational Patterns
### 1.1 - Abstract Factory
The abstract factory pattern is a design pattern that allows for the creation of groups of related objects without the requirement of specifying the exact concrete classes that will be used. 
One of a number of factory classes generates the object sets.

### 1.2 - Factory Method
The factory method pattern is a design pattern that allows for the creation of objects without specifying the type of object that is to be created in code. A factory class contains a method that allows determination of the created type at run-time.
